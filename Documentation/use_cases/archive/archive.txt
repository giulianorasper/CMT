This folder contains use-cases which have been removed.
In the following there is a list of removed use cases and why exactly they were removed.

votings_sys_failure:
Since there are no requirements specified in the contract, there is no 
need for the application to handle system failures as described.

login_reg_user:
This use case will be refined entirely focusing just on the "regular login" aspect.
Since login on secondary devices is a may have it should not be shown in use cases.
For the refinded version:
  - state explicitly that the described token is an auth token, not a login token
  - state explicitly that a user may login before the conference (or an additional use case for that)
